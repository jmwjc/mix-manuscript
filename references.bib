  abstract = {The meshless techniques are improved to simulate a wide range of the physical models. Two common forms of the meshless methods are strong and (local) weak forms. In the current paper, we employ the local weak form technique to simulate the two-dimensional non-stationary Boussinesq equations. In the present method the trial functions have been selected from the shape functions of the RKPM. Also, the test function is based upon a Ck function. At first, the time variable has been discretized via a finite difference scheme and then the space direction has been approximated by using the MLPG procedure. In this procedure, by employing the continuity equation, the two-dimensional non-stationary Boussinesq equations have been transformed to a pressure Poisson equation. After solving the obtained pressure Poisson equation, the velocity of fluid in the x- and y-directions and also the temperature can be updated, directly. Numerical examples confirm the ability of the developed technique.},

Doing so, the proposed elements can be used efficiently for 3D and thin shell applications. The starting point of the work relies on the analysis of the subspace of incompressible deformations associated with the standard (displacement-based) fully integrated and reduced integrated hexahedral elements. Prediction capabilities for both formulations are defined related to nearly-incompressible problems and an enhanced strain approach is developed to improve the performance of the earlier formulation in this case. With the insight into volumetric locking gained and benefiting from a recently proposed enhanced transverse shear strain procedure for shell applications, a new element conjugating both the capabilities of efficient solid and shell formulations is obtained. Numerical results attest the robustness and efficiency of the proposed approach, when compared to solid and shell elements well-established in the literature.},

  abstract = {We develop H(div)-conforming mixed finite element methods for the unsteady Stokes equations modeling single-phase incompressible fluid flow. A projection method in the framework of the incremental pressure correction methodology is applied, where a predictor problem and a corrector problem are sequentially solved, accounting for the viscous effects and incompressibility, respectively. The predictor problem is based on a stress--velocity mixed formulation, while the corrector projection problem uses a velocity--pressure mixed formulation. The scheme results in pointwise divergence-free velocity computed at the end of each time step. We establish unconditional stability and first order in time accuracy. In the implementation we focus on generally unstructured triangular grids. We employ a second order multipoint flux mixed finite element method based on the next-to-the-lowest order Raviart--Thomas space RT1 and a suitable quadrature rule. In the predictor problem this approach allows for a local stress elimination, resulting in element-based systems for each velocity component with three degrees of freedom per element. Similarly, in the corrector problem, the velocity is locally eliminated and an element-based system for the pressure is solved. At the end of each time step we obtain a second order accurate H(div)-conforming piecewise linear velocity, which is pointwise divergence free. We present a series of numerical tests to illustrate the performance of the method.}

  abstract = {We present in this paper a discussion of the properties of dierent mixed and enhanced {\textregistered}nite element formulations in the {\textregistered}nite deformation range based on closed-form expressions of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a rectangular element under an axial stress in plane strain. These analyses allow to identify the locking properties of the {\textregistered}nite elements in dierent situations (namely, incompressible and shear locking), as well the appearance of numerical instabilities. In particular, we identify the presence of material instabilities, that is, negative stiness in the constant strain response of the material (and so exact and independent of the particular {\textregistered}nite element under consideration) as the cause for the appearance of numerical instabilities in the form of hourglassing. This is particularly the case in the original enhanced elements in plane strain problems. This situation is to be contrasted with the standard mixed Q1/P0 element, which is shown to avoid these numerical instabilities in the plane strain case through an alternative regularization of the volumetric stiness contributions to the hourglass modes. This observation allows for the identi{\textregistered}cation of a new assumed/enhanced formulation that avoids the observed numerical instabilities in the plane strain, without resorting to stabilization techniques relying on user-de{\textregistered}ned parameters. The new formulation simply involves the constant scaling of the original enhanced deformation gradient with only two enhanced modes, maintaining the full locking-free response of the element and the important strain driven structure of the {\textregistered}nite element formulation. Full details of the numerical implementation of these ideas are presented, as well as several numerical simulations illustrating the performance of the new formulation. \# 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In addition to the obvious regularity and integral conditions these consist of at most one compatibility condition at each vertex of the polygon. In the special case of homogeneous boundary data, it is necessary and sufficient that f belong to W (over s to p) (Omega), have mean value zero, and vanish at each vertex. (The latter condition only applies if s is large enough that the point values make sense.) We construct a solution operator which is independent of s and p.

If more precise values are required, one can try to compute a numerical approximation. This involves, in general, approximation of the domain and then the computation of a discrete LBB constant that can be obtained from the numerical solution of an eigenvalue problem for the Stokes system. This eigenvalue problem does not fall into a class for which standard results about numerical approximations can be applied. Indeed, many reasonable finite element methods do not yield a convergent approximation. In this article, we show that under fairly weak conditions on the approximation of the domain, the LBB constant is an upper semi-continuous shape functional, and we give more restrictive sufficient conditions for its continuity with respect to the domain. For numerical approximations based on variational formulations of the Stokes eigenvalue problem, we also show upper semi-continuity under weak approximation properties, and we give stronger conditions that are sufficient for convergence of the discrete LBB constant towards the continuous LBB constant. Numerical examples show that our conditions are, while not quite optimal, not very far from necessary.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work available towards the development of 3-D stress-based hybrid solid elements for isogeometric analysis (IGA). In this work, we propose stress-based hybrid solid elements to alleviate the issue of locking arising in non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS)-based IGA. The present work primarily focuses on the linear elasticity, though the formulation can be extended to the non-linear regime. We believe that the excellent coarse mesh accuracy provided by the proposed elements will further enhance the IGA in various applications, especially involving structures with high aspect ratios and nearly incompressible materials. The proposed elements are constructed based on a two-field Hellinger--Reissner variational statement, where stress and displacement fields are interpolated separately. The stress interpolation functions have been derived systemically for various orders of NURBS displacement interpolation functions. Further, we show mathematically that the choice of the stress interpolation functions is free from spurious zero-energy modes. Lastly, the results of numerous 3-D linear-elastic benchmark problems are presented to demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed elements. The results confirm the superior coarse mesh accuracy for structures with high aspect ratios and almost incompressible materials.},

Finally, we also present a numerical test that is useful to identify numerically whether, for the solution of the general Stokes flow problem, a given finite element discretization satisfies the stability and optimal error bound conditions.},

The weighted-residual method enforces weakly the balance equation with the natural boundary condition and also the kinematic equation that links the elementwise and the assumed-deformation gradient. Assumed gradient operators are derived via nodal integration from the kinematic-weighted residual. A variety of finite element shapes fits the derived framework: four-node tetrahedra, eight-, 27-, and 64-node hexahedra are presented here. Since the assumed-deformation gradients are expressed entirely in terms of the nodal displacements, the degrees of freedom are only the primitive variables (displacements at the nodes). The formulation allows for general anisotropic materials and no volumetric/deviatoric split is required. The consistent tangent operator is inexpensive and symmetric. Furthermore, the material update and the tangent moduli computation are carried out exactly as for classical displacement-based models; the only deviation is the consistent use of the assumed-deformation gradient in place of the displacement-derived deformation gradient. Examples illustrate the performance with respect to the ability of the present technique to resist volumetric locking. A constraint count can partially explain the insensitivity of the resulting finite element models to locking in the incompressible limit. Copyright {\copyright} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The basis of the formulation is the streamline upwind concept, which provides an accurate multidimensional generalization of optimal one-dimensional upwind schemes. When implemented as a consistent Petrov-Galerkin weighted residual method, it is shown that the new formulation is not subject to the artificial diffusion criticisms associated with many classical upwind methods. The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100.},

The striking advantage is the simplicity among other higher-order nonconforming schemes and its geometric flexibility as a polytopal method on the expanse of a parameter-free refined stabilization. This paper utilizes just one reconstruction operator for the linear Green strain and therefore does not rely on a split in deviatoric and spherical behavior as in the classical HHO discretization. The a priori error analysis provides quasi-best approximation with -independent equivalence constants. The reliable and (up to data oscillations) efficient a posteriori error estimates are stabilization-free and -robust. The error analysis is carried out on simplicial meshes to allow conforming piecewise polynomial finite elements in the kernel of the stabilization terms. Numerical benchmarks provide empirical evidence for optimal convergence rates of the a posteriori error estimator in an associated adaptive mesh-refining algorithm also in the incompressible limit, where this paper provides corresponding assertions for the Stokes problem.},

  abstract = {Quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of the Galerkin method suffer from volumetric locking when applied to nearly-incompressible linear elasticity. Volumetric locking causes not only smaller displacements than expected, but also large-amplitude spurious oscillations of normal stresses. Continuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements have been recently introduced to remove membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear plane curved Kirchhoff rods (Casquero et al. in Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 360:112765, 2022). In this work, we propose two generalizations of CAS elements (named CAS1 and CAS2 elements) to overcome volumetric locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of nearly-incompressible linear elasticity. CAS1 elements linearly interpolate the strains at the knots in each direction for the term in the variational form involving the first Lam{\'e} parameter while CAS2 elements linearly interpolate the dilatational strains at the knots in each direction. For both element types, a displacement vector with \$\$C{\textasciicircum}1\$\$continuity across element boundaries results in assumed strains with \$\$C{\textasciicircum}0\$\$continuity across element boundaries. In addition, the implementation of the two locking treatments proposed in this work does not require any additional global or element matrix operations such as matrix inversions or matrix multiplications. The locking treatments are applied at the element level and the nonzero pattern of the global stiffness matrix is preserved. The numerical examples solved in this work show that CAS1 and CAS2 elements, using either two or three Gauss--Legrendre quadrature points per direction, are effective locking treatments since they not only result in more accurate displacements for coarse meshes, but also remove the spurious oscillations of normal stresses.},

Lack of minor symmetry in the material response tensor will lead to numerical convergence difficulties, especially in shear dominant problems. The projection method is used to avoid volumetric locking due to the nearly incompressible nature of rubber. The relation between the numerical penalty number and the material bulk modulus is characterized. The importance of this relation is demonstrated in the study of the apparent Young's modulus of bonded rubber units. The need to include higher order terms in the strain energy density function is presented in the numerical examples. Several classical elasticity problems are also analyzed.},

  abstract = {The previously developed reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) employs a high-order quadrature rule for desired domain integration accuracy. This leads to an over-constrained condition in the limit of incompressibility, and volumetric locking and pressure oscillation were encountered. The employment of a large support size in the reproducing kernel shape function increases the dependency in the discrete constraint equations at quadrature points and thereby relieves locking. However, this approach consumes high CPU and it cannot effectively resolve pressure oscillation difficulty. In this paper, a pressure projection method is introduced by locally projecting the pressure onto a lower-order space to reduce the number of independent discrete constraint equations. This approach relieves the over-constrained condition and thus eliminates volumetric locking and pressure oscillation without the expense of employing large support size in RKPM. The method is developed in a general framework of nearly incompressible finite elasticity and therefore linear problems are also applicable. To further reduce the computational cost, a stabilized reduced integration method based on an assumed strain approach on the gradient matrix associated with the deformation gradient is also introduced. The resulting stiffness matrix and force vector of RKPM are obtained explicitly without numerical integration.},

Direct nodal integration, on the other hand, leads to a numerical instability due to under integration and vanishing derivatives of shape functions at the nodes. A strain smoothing stabilization for nodal integration is proposed to eliminate spatial instability in nodal integration. For convergence, an integration constraint (IC) is introduced as a necessary condition for a linear exactness in the mesh-free Galerkin approximation. The gradient matrix of strain smoothing is shown to satisfy IC using a divergence theorem. No numerical control parameter is involved in the proposed strain smoothing stabilization. The numerical results show that the accuracy and convergent rates in the mesh-free method with a direct nodal integration are improved considerably by the proposed stabilized conforming nodal integration method. It is also demonstrated that the Gauss integration method fails to meet IC in mesh-free discretization. For this reason the proposed method provides even better accuracy than Gauss integration for Galerkin mesh-free method as presented in several numerical examples.

It is shown that with the proper choice of independent source points and collocation points for the radial basis approximations in the pressure and displacement fields, together with the analytically derived weights associated with the incompressibility constraint and boundary condition collocation equations, optimal convergence can be achieved. The optimal weights associated with the collocation equations are derived based on achieving balanced errors resulting from domain, boundaries, and constraint equations. Since in the proposed method the overdetermined system of the collocation equations is solved by a least squares method, independent pressure and displacement approximations can be selected without suffering from instability due to violation of the LBB stability condition.

However, large numbers of material points per element are required to reduce integration errors due to non-optimum placement of integration points. This restricts the ability of current material point methods in modelling realistic material behaviour. This paper presents for the first time a method to overcome finite deformation volumetric locking in standard and generalised interpolation material point methods for near-incompressible non-linear solid mechanics. The method does not place any restriction on the form of constitutive model used and is straightforward to implement into existing implicit material point method codes. The performance of the method is demonstrated on a number of two and three-dimensional examples and its correct implementation confirmed through convergence studies towards analytical solutions and by obtaining the correct order of convergence within the global Newton--Raphson equilibrium iterations. In particular, the proposed formulation has been shown to remove the over-stiff volumetric behaviour of conventional material point methods and reduce stress oscillations. It is straightforward to extend this approach to other material point methods and the presented formulation can be incorporated into all existing material point methods available in the literature.},

Findings The numerical experiences show the efficiency of parallel performance reaches a speedup of 35 compared to the serial implementation. Research limitations/implications This contribution is so far limited to two-dimensional (2D) geometries although the extension to three-dimension (3D) is straightforward regarding the meshing technique itself and the GPU implementation. The authors' works are based on a CUDA environment which is widely used by developers. C{\textbackslash}C++ and Java were the programming languages used. Other languages may of course lead to slightly different implementations. Practical implications This approach makes it possible to use bubble meshing technique for both initial design and optimization, as excellent meshes can be built in few seconds. Originality/value Compared to previous works, this contribution shows that the scalability of the bubble meshing technique needs to solve two key issues: reach a T(N) global cost of the implementation and reach a very fast size map interpolation strategy.},

  abstract = {A new stabilized finite element method for the Stokes problem is presented. The method is obtained by modification of the mixed variational equation by using local L2 polynomial pressure projections. Our stabilization approach is motivated by the inherent inconsistency of equal-order approximations for the Stokes equations, which leads to an unstable mixed finite element method. Application of pressure projections in conjunction with minimization of the pressure--velocity mismatch eliminates this inconsistency and leads to a stable variational formulation. Unlike other stabilization methods, the present approach does not require specification of a stabilization parameter or calculation of higher-order derivatives, and always leads to a symmetric linear system. The new method can be implemented at the element level and for affine families of finite elements on simplicial grids it reduces to a simple modification of the weak continuity equation. Numerical results are presented for a variety of equal-order continuous velocity and pressure elements in two and three dimensions. Copyright {\copyright} 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A semi-incremental two-step fractional projection method is first used to discretize the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, followed by a mixed formulation used to solve the pressure equations. Using the mixed formulation, it is expected that the accuracy of the pressure approximation and in particular the pressure gradients are improved compared with that of conventional solution methods and in particular Discrete Least Squares Meshfree (DLSM) method. DLSM method is based on minimizing the least squares functional defined as the weighted summation of the squared residuals of the differential equation and its boundary conditions. The method is not subject to the Ladyzenskaja--Babuska--Brezzi (LBB) condition since it formulates the problem in the form of a minimization problem rather than a saddle-point problem. A number of numerical experiments are used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed MDLSM method and to compare its accuracy against the DLSM method. From the results, it is found that the proposed MDLSM method can efficiently simulate the incompressible fluid flow problems. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the MDLSM method has higher accuracy compared with the DLSM method.},

We adapt the three-field formulation for nearly incompressible hyperelasticity introduced in Chavan et~al. (2007) to the fully incompressible case. The mixed formulation is of Hu--Washizu type and it differs from other approaches in that we use the Kirchhoff stress, displacement, and pressure as principal unknowns. We also discuss the solvability of the linearised problem restricted to neo-Hookean materials, illustrating the interplay between the coupling blocks. We construct a family of mixed finite element schemes (with different polynomial degrees) for simplicial meshes and verify its error decay through computational tests. We also propose a new augmented Lagrangian preconditioner that improves convergence properties of iterative solvers. The numerical performance of the family of mixed methods is assessed with benchmark solutions, and the applicability of the formulation is further tested in a model of cardiac biomechanics using orthotropic strain energy densities. The proposed methods are advantageous in terms of physical fidelity (as the Kirchhoff stress can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy and no locking is observed) and convergence (the discretisation and the preconditioners are robust and computationally efficient, and they compare favourably at least with respect to classical displacement--pressure schemes).},

In this work, we propose lumped-assumed-strain (LAS) elements, a projection-based assumed-strain treatment that removes shear and membrane locking for a very broad range of slenderness ratios. For a NURBS patch with basis functions of degree p and Cp-1 continuity across element boundaries, the space of the assumed strains is defined on a B-spline patch with the same elements, but using basis functions of degree p-1 and Cp-2 continuity across element boundaries. The assumed strains are obtained by performing a L2 projection of the compatible strains at the patch level in which the consistent mass matrix is substituted with the lumped mass matrix. Our numerical investigations suggest that LAS elements need either the same or slightly finer mesh resolutions than {\=B} elements in order for the relative errors in L2 norm of the unknowns and the stress resultants to be all below 1\%. However, LAS elements are significantly more computationally efficient than {\=B} elements for a given mesh. The use of C1-continuous quadratic LAS elements with 2 Gauss--Legendre quadrature points per element exhibit superconvergence of the stress resultants for most slenderness ratios, making it a particularly cost-effective choice of obtaining accurate results. When compared with linear Lagrange {\=B} elements with 2 Gauss--Legendre quadrature points per element, C1-continuous quadratic LAS elements with 2 Gauss--Legendre quadrature points per element require far fewer elements in order to obtain relative errors in L2 norm of the unknowns and the stress resultants smaller than 1\%.},

Equal-order interpolations for velocities and pressure are used. It is well-known from the meshbased context, i.e. from finite volume and finite element methods, that in convection-dominated flow problems in Eulerian or ALE formulation, stabilization is a crucial requirement for reliable solutions. Also, stabilization is needed in order to enable equalorder interpolations of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. Standard stabilization techniques, developed in a meshbased context, are extended to meshfree methods. It is found that the same structure of the stabilization schemes may be used, however the aspect of the stabilization parameter, weighting the stabilization terms, has to be reconsidered. In Part II of this work, the resulting stabilized meshfree Galerkin method is coupled with a stabilized finite element method. The resulting coupled method employs the comparatively costly meshfree Galerkin method only where it is needed---i.e. in areas of the domain, where a mesh is difficult to maintain---and the efficient meshbased finite element method is used in the rest of the domain. The fluid solver resulting from this technique is able to solve complex flow problems, involving large deformations of the physical domain and/or moving and rotating obstacles.},

  abstract = {Wrinkles commonly occur in uniaxially stretched rectangular hyperelastic membranes with clamped-clamped boundaries, and can vanish upon excess stretching. Here we develop a modeling and resolution framework to solve this complex instability problem with highly geometric and material nonlinearities. We extend the nonlinear F{\"o}ppl-von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n thin plate model to finite membrane strain regime for various compressible and incompressible hyperelastic materials. Under plane stress condition, 2D hyperelastic constitutive models can be systematically deduced based on general 3D strain energy potentials, e.g., Saint-Venant Kirchhoff, neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Gent model and Gent-Gent model. Moreover, we establish a novel and efficient numerical resolution framework combining a path-following continuation technique by Asymptotic Numerical Method (ANM) and a discretization by a spectral method. The main advantages of this framework include the generality for both compressible and incompressible materials, ease of programming, high precision and efficient continuation predictor. Based on the proposed approach, effect of different incompressible constitutive models on the post-buckling response is investigated, which shows that restabilization points and wrinkling amplitudes are quantitatively influenced. However, for compressible materials, Poisson's ratio plays a critical role in the wrinkling and restabilization behavior. We find that smaller Poisson's ratio makes later onset of wrinkling, lower amplitude and earlier disappearance of wrinkles. Besides, severe strain-stiffening phenomena are explored by accounting for phenomenological models such as Gent model and Gent-Gent model. Efficiency and accuracy of the proposed modeling and resolution framework were examined by comparing with some benchmarks.},

We employ a modified polynomial pressure projection stabilisation method to stabilise and filter spurious pressure modes, where the gradient is corrected as proposed by Duan et~al. (2014). The gradient correction is used to counteract the lack of variational consistency when numerical integration of the rational shape functions is performed, a threat that could undermine the stabilisation effort.

  abstract = {This study investigates the application of formulations employed by standard Bubnov-Galerkin Finite Elements to alleviate volumetric locking in the context of the Absolute Nodal Coordinate Formulation (ANCF). Volumetric locking is a prevalent phenomenon that occurs when linearly interpolated displacement fields are used to model incompressible phenomena. Although linear interpolations for the displacement field offer computational efficiency, their direct utilization can frequently yield erroneous solutions and slow convergence rates when applied to modeling incompressible materials. Commonly used techniques to reduce volumetric locking in classical finite elements include reduced and selective integration, mixed two/three field variational formulations, and F-bar methods. This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of these techniques when applied to a two and three-dimensional linear ANCF-based continuum beam elements. Our findings demonstrate that most of the locking alleviation techniques yielded expected results compared to classical finite elements. Nevertheless and contrary to findings in the finite element literature, the mixed two/three field variational formulation, when used with linear ANCF-based continuum beam elements, improved the convergence rate only in the case of uniaxial tensile testing. For the bending mode, mixed ANCF elements significantly overestimated the displacements. While techniques alleviate locking for some deformation modes, the paper concludes that no definitive technique exists to completely resolve volumetric locking effects observed in linear ANCF elements, for all deformation modes.},

  abstract = {In this paper a displacement-based meshfree-enriched finite element method, which was proposed for the linear modeling of near-incompressible elasticity, is generalized for the nonlinear analysis of elastomers. A four-noded triangular element based on the convex meshfree approximation is utilized to discretize the domain. An area-weighted smoothing of deformation gradient is performed on the four-noded triangular elements to provide a locking-free analysis for near-incompressible materials. The L2-orthogonality property of the smoothing operator enables the employed Hu--Washizu--de Veubeke variational to be degenerated to an assumed strain method. Different from the extra displacement fields in the conventional assumed strain methods or bubble-enriched finite element methods, the enriched meshfree nodes carry physical quantities and are not eliminated by a local static condensation procedure. This leads to a displacement-based formulation easily to be implemented in the existing finite element code. Several numerical examples are solved to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed formulation for the large deformation analysis of elastomers.},

  abstract = {Volumetric locking (locking in the incompressible limit) for linear elastic isotropic materials is studied in the context of the element-free Galerkin method. The modal analysis developed here shows that the number of non-physical locking modes is independent of the dilation parameter (support of the interpolation functions). Thus increasing the dilation parameter does not suppress locking. Nevertheless, an increase in the dilation parameter does reduce the energy associated with the non-physical locking modes; thus, in part, it alleviates the locking phenomena. This is shown for linear and quadratic orders of consistency. Moreover, the biquadratic order of consistency, as in {\"y}nite elements, improves the locking behaviour. Although more locking modes are present in the element-free Galerkin method with quadratic consistency than with standard biquadratic {\"y}nite elements. Finally, numerical examples are shown to validate the modal analysis. In particular, the conclusions of the modal analysis are also con{\"y}rmed in an elastoplastic example.

For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection-diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The divergence constraint of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations is revisited in the mixed finite element framework. While many stable and convergent mixed elements have been developed throughout the past four decades, most classical methods relax the divergence constraint and only enforce the condition discretely.  As a result, these methods introduce a pressure-dependent consistency error which can potentially pollute the computed velocity. These methods are not robust in the sense that a contribution from the right-hand side, which influences only the pressure in the continuous equations, impacts both velocity and pressure in the discrete equations. This article reviews the theory and practical implications of relaxing the divergence constraint. Several approaches for improving the discrete mass balance or even for computing divergence-free solutions will be discussed: grad-div stabilization, higher order mixed methods derived on the basis of an exact de Rham complex, \$H(div)\$-conforming finite elements, and mixed methods with an appropriate reconstruction of the test functions.  Numerical examples illustrate both the potential effects of using nonrobust discretizations and the improvements obtained by utilizing pressure-robust discretizations.},

To enforce incompressibility a multiplicative split of the deformation gradient into a volumetric and an isochoric part is a very common approach. However, the finite element analysis of such problems often suffers from severe volumetric locking effects and numerical instabilities. In this paper, we present novel methods to overcome volumetric locking phenomena for using stabilized P1--P1 elements. We introduce different stabilization techniques and demonstrate the high robustness and computational efficiency of the chosen methods. In two benchmark problems from the literature as well as an advanced application to cardiac electromechanics, we compare the approach to standard linear elements and show the accuracy and versatility of the methods to simulate anisotropic, nearly and fully incompressible materials. We demonstrate the potential of this numerical framework to accelerate accurate simulations of biological tissues to the extent of enabling patient-specific parameterization studies, where numerous forward simulations are required.},

  abstract = {Rubber-like materials that are commonly used in structural applications are modelled using hyperelastic material models. Most of the hyperelastic materials are nearly incompressible, which poses challenges, i.e., volumetric locking during numerical modelling. There exist many formulations in the context of the finite element method, among which the mixed displacement-pressure formulation is robust. However, such a displacement-pressure formulation is less explored in meshfree methods, which mitigates the problem associated with mesh distortion during large deformation. This work addresses this issue of alleviating volumetric locking in the element-free Galerkin method (EFGM), which is one of the popular meshfree methods. A two-field mixed variational formulation using the perturbed Lagrangian approach within the EFGM framework is proposed for modelling nearly incompressible hyperelastic material models, such as Neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin. Taking advantage of the meshless nature of the EFGM, this work introduces a unique approach by randomly distributing pressure nodes across the geometry, following specific guidelines. A wide spectrum of problems involving bending, tension, compression, and contact is solved using two approaches of the proposed displacement-pressure node formulation involving regular and irregular pressure node distribution. It is observed that both approaches give accurate results compared to the reference results, though the latter offers flexibility in the pressure nodal distribution.},

  abstract = {The standard material point method (MPM) encounters severe numerical difficulties in simulating shell structures. In order to overcome the shortcomings of locking effects, the discretization size of background grid should be small enough, usually smaller than 1/5 of the shell thickness, which however will lead to prohibitive computational cost. A novel solid shell material point method (SSMPM) is proposed to efficiently model the large deformation of thin structures. The SSMPM describes the material domain of shell structures by shell particles with hexahedral particle domains. The locking treatments of solid shell element are then introduced in SSMPM, which results in the correction of strain field throughout the shell thickness. Namely, the assumed natural strain (ANS) method is adopted to eliminate the shear locking and trapezoidal locking, while the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method is employed to eliminate the thickness locking. With the precise description of bending modes, a single layer of particles and a coarse background grid could be used in shell structure simulations with the SSMPM, which dramatically increases the computational efficiency. A local multi-mesh contact method is presented to naturally couple SSMPM and MPM for the contact situations of shells with other objects. Several numerical examples, including beam vibration, pinched cylinder with free edges and full hemispherical shell, are performed to verify and validate the SSMPM, which shows that the SSMPM considerably outperforms the standard MPM in these situations. A fluid--structure interaction problem and the penetration of a thin plate are investigated based on the contact method and the results are in good agreement with those in the literature.},

The HVEM does not require any stabilization term, unlike classical VEM formulations which are affected by the choice of stabilization parameters. The algorithmic tangent matrix is derived consistently and analytically. A standard strain-driven formulation and a Backward-Euler time integration scheme are adopted. The return mapping process for the stress evaluation is formulated at the element level to preserve the stress interpolation as plasticity evolves. Even though general constitutive laws can be readily considered, to test the robustness of HVEM, an elastic-perfectly plastic behavior is adopted. In such a case, the return mapping process is efficiently solved using a Sequential Quadratic Programming Algorithm. The solution is free from volumetric locking and from spurious hardening effects that are observed in stabilized VEM. The numerical results confirm the accuracy of HVEM for rough meshes and high rate of convergence in recovering the collapse load.},

An approach for hourglass control is proposed such that the stabilization operators are obtained simply by taking the partial derivatives of the generalized strain rate vector with respect to the natural co-ordinates so that the elements require no stabilization parameter. To improve accuracy over the traditional onepoint-quadrature elements, several quadrature points are used to integrate the internal forces, especially for tracing the plastic fronts in the mesh during loading and unloading in elastic-plastic analysis. Two- and four-point-quadrature elements are proposed for use in the two- and three-dimensional elements, respectively. Other multiple-quadrature points can also be employed. Several numerical examples such as thin beam, plate and shell problems are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed elements.},

  abstract = {Abstract A new continuous reproducing kernel interpolation function which explores the attractive features of the flexible time-frequency and space-wave number localization of a window function is developed. This method is motivated by the theory of wavelets and also has the desirable attributes of the recently proposed smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods, moving least squares methods (MLSM), diffuse element methods (DEM) and element-free Galerkin methods (EFGM). The proposed method maintains the advantages of the free Lagrange or SPH methods; however, because of the addition of a correction function, it gives much more accurate results. Therefore it is called the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM). In computer implementation RKPM is shown to be more efficient than DEM and EFGM. Moreover, if the window function is C{$\infty$}, the solution and its derivatives are also C{$\infty$} in the entire domain. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on the 1D diffusion equation reveal the stability conditions and the effect of the dilation parameter on the unusually high convergence rates of the proposed method. Two-dimensional examples of advection-diffusion equations and compressible Euler equations are also presented together with 2D multiple-scale decompositions.},

It plays an essential role in determining whether or not the problem is well-posed and governs the choice of finite elements in the discretization. This paper examines the discrete eigenstructure of a well-known Lagrange multiplier formulation for linear elasticity or Stokes-flow. It shows how the weak incompressibility constraint is reflected in the elementary divisor structure of the eigenproblem whose solution determines the finite element approximation to the natural modes. In this context the discrete LBB condition can be seen to be a condition determining the limiting disposition, as the mesh parameter decreases, of a matrix pencil with infinite eigenvalues. Pure pressure modes and the load vectors required to transmit them are paired in cyclic subspaces of the infinite eigenspace. This pairing can be related to a well-known heuristic interpretation of the LBB condition. The relationship between the natural mode eigenproblem and the eigenproblems which determine the norm of the inverse of the discrete operator of a static or steady-flow problem is described. Finally, because of the equivalence between classes of mixed and penalty formulations, it is shown that these results apply to penalty/reduced integration finite element methods.},

Error estimates for finite element solutions to incompressible Stokesian flows are considered. The estimate for the velocities does not require the satisfaction of the discrete LBB condition. Conditions for convergence of the raw pressures in a negative norm are established. A semi-norm inf-sup condition can be used to establish more usual error estimates for pressures projected into an auxiliary trial space. Numerical evidence suggests that such post-processing may only be necessary for problems with sufficiently rough exact solutions. An example is given of pressure measurements in flows over a transverse slot. Small---but numerically significant---pressure differences are extracted from a pressure field with seemingly chaotic checkerboarding. Similar examples indicate that the Stokesian results carry over to problems with convective and non-Newtonian nonlinearities.},

The multiscale method arises from a decomposition of the displacement field into coarse (resolved) and fine (unresolved) scales. The resulting stabilized-mixed form consistently represents the fine computational scales in the solution and thus possesses higher coarse mesh accuracy. The ensuing finite element formulation allows arbitrary combinations of interpolation functions for the displacement and stress fields. Specifically, equal order interpolations that are easy to implement but violate the celebrated Babushka-Brezzi inf-sup condition, become stable and convergent. Since the proposed framework is based on sound variational foundations, it provides a basis for a priori error analysis of the system. Numerical simulations pass various element patch tests and confirm optimal convergence in the norms considered.},

The efficacy of these formulations is compared with alternative stabilization techniques and validated across various two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems to assess its accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract = {It is often found that tangent-stiffness finite element solutions for elastic-plastic materials exhibit much too stiff a response in the fully plastic range. This is most striking for the perfectly plastic material idealization, in which case a limit load exists within conventional small displacement gradient assumptions. However, finite element solutions often exceed the limit load by substantial amounts, and in some cases have no limit load at all. It is shown that a cause of this inaccuracy is that incremental deformation fields of typical two and three-dimensional finite elements are highly constrained at or near the limit load. This is shown to enforce unreasonable kinematic constraints on the modes of deformation which assemblages of elements are capable of exhibiting. A general criterion for testing a mesh with topologically similar repeat units is given, and the analysis shows that only a few conventional element types and arrangements are, or can be made, suitable for computations in the fully plastic range. Further, a new variational principle, which can easily and simply be incorporated into an existing finite element program, is presented. This allows accurate computations to be made even for element designs that would not normally be suitable. Numerical results are given for three plane strain problems, namely pure bending of a beam, a thick-walled tube under pressure, and a deep double edge cracked tensile specimen. These illustrate the effects of various element designs and of the new variational procedure. An appendix extends the discussion to elastic-plastic computation at finite strain.},

We introduce a perturbation of the bilinear form of the displacement which allows for the elimination of the bubble functions. Together with eliminating Darcy's velocity by hybridization, we obtain an eliminated system whose size is the same as the classical P1-RT0-P0 discretization.

Two pressure-correction strategies including the scalar auxiliary variable approach are proposed to enhance the accuracy of the method. A rigorous stability analysis is also carried out in this study for the considered strategies. Numerical results are presented for three benchmark problems to validate the unconditional stability and to demonstrate the performance of the proposed fractional-step method for solving unsteady incompressible viscous flows.

  abstract = {A displacement-based Galerkin meshfree method for large deformation analysis of nearly-incompressible elastic solids is presented. Nodal discretization of the domain is defined by a Delaunay tessellation (three-node triangles and four-node tetrahedra), which is used to form the meshfree basis functions and to numerically integrate the weak form integrals. In the proposed approach for nearly-incompressible solids, a volume-averaged nodal projection operator is constructed to average the dilatational constraint at a node from the displacement field of surrounding nodes. The nodal dilatational constraint is then projected onto the linear approximation space. The displacement field is constructed on the linear space and enriched with bubble-like meshfree basis functions for stability. The new procedure leads to a displacement-based formulation that is similar to F-bar methodologies in finite elements and isogeometric analysis. We adopt maximum-entropy meshfree basis functions, and the performance of the meshfree method is demonstrated on benchmark problems using structured and unstructured background meshes in two and three dimensions. The nonlinear simulations reveal that the proposed methodology provides improved robustness for nearlyincompressible large deformation analysis on Delaunay meshes.},

  abstract = {A new computational framework for large strain elasticity in principal stretches is presented. Distinct from existing literature, the proposed formulation makes direct use of principal stretches rather than their squares that is, eigenvalues of Cauchy-Green strain tensor. The proposed framework has three key features. First, the eigen-decomposition of the tangent elasticity and initial (geometric) stiffness operators is obtained in closed-form from principal information alone. Crucially, these newly found eigenvalues describe the general convexity conditions of isotropic hyperelastic energies. In other words, convexity is postulated concisely through tangent eigenvalues supplementing the original work of Ball (Arch Ration Mech Anal. 1976; 63(4): 337--403). Consequently, this novel finding opens the door for designing efficient automated Newton-style algorithms with stabilised tangents via closed-form semipositive definite projection or spectral shifting that converge irrespective of mesh resolution, quality, loading scenario and without relying on path-following techniques. A critical study of closed-form tangent stabilisation in the context of isotropic hyperelasticity is therefore undertaken in this work. Second, in addition to high order displacement-based formulation, mixed Hu-Washizu variational principles are formulated in terms of principal stretches by introducing stretch work conjugate Lagrange multipliers that enforce principal stretch-stress compatibility. This is similar to enhanced strain methods. However, the resulting mixed finite element scheme is cost-efficient, specially compared to approximating the entire strain tensors since the formulation is in the scalar space of singular values. Third, the proposed framework facilitates simulating rigid and stiff systems and those that are nearly-inextensible in principal directions, a constituent of elasticity that cannot be easily studied using standard formulations.},

It uses a higher-order continuous Galerkin finite element method for the space discretization and leverages a stabilized formulation that includes both the SUPG and PSPG terms. We solve the non-linear problem in a fully coupled way, using a Newton-Krylov method, which is preconditioned by a monolithic geometric multigrid solver. To evaluate its efficiency in terms of time to solution and scalability on modern high-performance computers, we use a manufactured solution, a steady flow around a sphere with Reynolds number Re=150 and the Taylor--Green vortex benchmark at Re=1600. The results indicate that the solver is robust and scales for both steady-state and transient problems. We compare the matrix-free solver to a matrix-based version and show it exhibits lower memory requirements, better scalability, and significant speedups (10--100{\texttimes} for higher-order elements). Moreover, we demonstrate that a matrix-free implementation is highly efficient when using higher-order elements, which provide higher accuracy at a lower number of degrees of freedom for complex steady problems. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that uses a matrix-free monolithic geometric multigrid preconditioner to solve the stabilized Navier-Stokes equations.

This formulation circumvents the restriction on the displacement and pressure fields due to the Babu{\v s}ka--Brezzi condition and provides freedom in choosing interpolation functions in the incompressible or nearly incompressible limit, typical in metal forming applications. Moreover, it facilitates the use of low order simplex elements (i.e. P1/P1), reducing the degrees of freedom required for the solution in the incompressible limit when stable elements are necessary. Linearization of the weak form is derived for implementation into a finite element code. Numerical experiments with P1/P1 elements show that the method is effective in incompressible conditions and can be advantageous in metal forming analysis.},

At first, the deformation of the cylinder, containing an undetermined parameter-the void radius, is given by using the condition of incompressibility of the material. Then the exact analytic formulas to determine the critical load and the bifurcation values for the parameter are obtained by solving the differential equation for the deformation function. Thus, an analytic solution for bifurcation problems in incompressible anisotropic hyper-elastic materials is obtained. The solution depends on the degree of anisotropy of the material. It shows that the bifurcation may occur locally to the right or to the left, depending on the degree of anisotropy, and the condition for the bifurcation to the right or to the left is discussed. The stress distributions subsequent to the cavitation are given and the jumping and concentration of stresses are discussed. The stability of solutions is discussed through comparison of the associated potential energies. The bifurcation to the left is a `snap cavitation'. The growth of a pre-existing void in the cylinder is also observed. The results for a similar problem in three dimensions were obtained by Polignone and Horgan.},

Although this approach enables the MPM to model large deformation efficiently, it also results in the loss of Galerkin exactness in the variational equation and possible stress oscillation due to the cell-crossing instability. This paper introduces a novel MPM formulation that employs the reproducing kernel approximation to overcome the cell-crossing instability due to the higher-order continuity employed. The reproducing kernel method also ensures completeness in the approximation. In addition, this paper implements a variationally consistent material point integration scheme into the MPM framework to address the issue of Galerkin exactness, which is shown to recover theoretical convergence and increase the robustness of the formulation. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method recovers optimal accuracy and stability compared to the conventional approaches and removes spurious pressure oscillation. The F-bar stabilization method of overcoming pressure instability is then coupled with the presented formulation to demonstrate its ability to accurately model incompressible materials.},

  abstract = {The simulation of structural problems involving the deformations of volumetric bodies is of paramount importance in many areas of engineering. Although the use of tetrahedral elements is extremely appealing, tetrahedral discretisations are generally known as very stiff and are hence often avoided in typical simulation workflows. The development of mixed displacement--pressure approaches has allowed to effectively overcome this problem leading to a class of locking-free elements which can effectively compete with hexahedral discretisations while retaining obvious advantages in the mesh generation step. Despite such advantages the adoption of the technology within commercial codes is not yet pervasive. This can be attributed to two different reasons: the difficulty in making use of standard constitutive libraries and the implied continuity of the pressure, which makes the application of the method questionable in the context of multi-material problems. Current paper proposes the adoption of the volumetric strain instead of the pressure as a nodal value. Such choice leads to the definition of a modified strain making the use of standard strain-driven constitutive laws straightforward. At the same time, the continuity of the volumetric strain across multimaterial interfaces can be understood as a sort of kinematic constraint (stresses can still remain discontinuous across material interfaces). The new element also opens the door to the use of anisotropic constitutive laws, which are typically problematic in the context of mixed elements.},

  abstract = {This study presents an innovative approach for developing a reduced-order model (ROM) tailored specifically for nearly incompressible materials at large deformations. The formulation relies on a three-field variational approach to capture the behavior of these materials. To construct the ROM, the full-scale model is initially solved using the finite element method (FEM), with snapshots of the displacement field being recorded and organized into a snapshot matrix. Subsequently, proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to extract dominant modes, forming a reduced basis for the ROM. Furthermore, we efficiently address the pressure and volumetric deformation fields by employing the k-means algorithm for clustering. A well-known three-field variational principle allows us to incorporate the clustered field variables into the ROM. To assess the performance of our proposed ROM, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of the ROM with and without clustering with the FEM solution. The results highlight the superiority of the ROM with pressure clustering, particularly when considering a limited number of modes, typically fewer than 10 displacement modes. Our findings are validated through two standard examples: one involving a block under compression and another featuring Cook's membrane. In both cases, we achieve substantial improvements based on the three-field mixed approach. These compelling results underscore the effectiveness of our ROM approach, which accurately captures nearly incompressible material behavior while significantly reducing computational expenses.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new computational method for fully automated triangular mesh generation, consistently applicable to wire-frame, surface, solid, and nonmanifold geometries. The method, called bubble rrzeshing, is based on the observation that a pattern of tightly packed spheres mimics a Voronoi diagram, from which a set of well-shaped Delaunay triangles and tetrahedral can be created by connecting the centers of the spheres. Given a domain geometry and a node-spacing function, spheres are packed on geometric entities, namely, vertices, edges, faces, and volumes, in ascending order of dimension. Once the domain is filled with spheres, mesh nodes are placed at the centers of these spheres and are then connected by constrained Delaunay triangulation and tet rahedrizat ion. To obtain a closely packed configuration of spheres, the authors devised a technique for physically based mesh relaxation with adaptive population control, The process of mesh relaxation significantly reduces the number of ill-shaped triangles and tetrahedral.},

  abstract = {In this work, we develop a novel energy-stable linear approach, which we name as auxiliary variable viscosity splitting (AVVS) method, to efficiently solve the incompressible fluid flows. Different from the projection-type methods with pressure correction, the AVVS method adopts the viscosity splitting strategy to split the original momentum equation into an intermediate momentum equation without divergence-free constraint and an advection-free momentum equation. A time-dependent auxiliary variable which has exact value 1 is introduced to construct a supplementary equation. The new model not only inherits the same dynamics of original incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, but also facilitates us to design linearly decoupled and energy-stable time-marching scheme. Comparing with the conventional projection-type schemes, the present method leads to an energy dissipation law with respect to kinetic energy instead of a modified energy including velocity and pressure gradient. In each time step, only two parabolic equations with constant coefficients and one Poisson equation need to be solved. Therefore, the numerical implementation is highly efficient. Moreover, the proposed AVVS method can be directly extended to construct linear, decoupled, and energy-stable scheme for the turbidity current system with slight modifications on the right-hand side of supplementary equation. Extensive numerical experiments are implemented to validate the accuracy, energy stability, and capability in complex fluid simulations.}

  abstract = {The immersed boundary method is a mathematical framework for modeling fluid--structure interaction. This formulation describes the momentum, viscosity, and incompressibility of the fluid--structure system in Eulerian form, and it uses Lagrangian coordinates to describe the structural deformations, stresses, and resultant forces. Integral transforms with Dirac delta function kernels connect the Eulerian and Lagrangian frames. The fluid and the structure are both typically treated as incompressible materials. The discretization scheme can readily enforce incompressibility exactly for the Eulerian velocity field. Because of the regularization of the Dirac delta function kernel, however, the Lagrangian velocity field of the solid generally does not retain this property. To obtain an immersed method for incompressible hyperelastic structures that is robust under large structural deformations, we introduce a volumetric energy in the solid region that stabilizes the formulation and improves the accuracy of the numerical scheme. This formulation augments the discrete Eulerian Lagrange multiplier for the incompressibility constraint, thereby improving the original method's accuracy. This volumetric energy is incorporated by decomposing the strain energy into isochoric and dilatational components, as in standard solid mechanics formulations of nearly incompressible elasticity. We study the performance of the stabilized method using several quasi-static solid mechanics benchmarks, a dynamic fluid--structure interaction benchmark, and a detailed three-dimensional model of esophageal transport. The accuracy achieved by the stabilized immersed formulation is empirically demonstrated to be comparable to that of a stabilized finite element method for incompressible elasticity using similar numbers of structural degrees of freedom.},

The present study is concerned with modelling damage evolution processes in these nonlinear materials whose structural responses are prone to locking when low-order kinematic interpolation is employed in the context of nonlinear Finite Element schemes. For this reason, a pair of gradient-enhanced continuum damage schemes are proposed with the aim of tackling mechanical failure problems in applications that exhibit shear and volumetric locking. In particular, we present the consistent formulation and the assessment of the corresponding performance of (i) a mixed displacement-enhanced assumed strain Q1Q1E24 employing a total Lagrangian formulation, and (ii) a three-field mixed displacement-pressure-Jacobian Q1Q1P0 formulation. The novel Q1Q1E24 and Q1Q1P0 formulations are consistently derived and numerically implemented, providing a satisfactory agreement with respect to ABAQUS built-in elements handling the treatment of shear and volumetric locking, respectively, in conjunction to the modelling damage phenomena via the use of a penalty-based gradient-enhanced formulation. This performance is examined via several numerical applications. Furthermore, the final example justifies the need for a formulation combining both mixed FE approaches to simulate problems encompassing both locking issues (shear and volumetric locking), which can be performed using a combination of the Q1Q1E24 and Q1Q1P0 herein proposed.},

  abstract = {Locking in finite elements has been a major concern since its early developments. It appears because poor numerical interpolation leads to an over-constrained system. This paper proposes a new formulation that asymptotically suppresses locking for the element free Galerkin (EFG) method in incompressible limit, i.e. the so-called volumetric locking. Originally it was claimed that EFG did not present volumetric locking. However, recently, performing a modal analysis, the senior author has shown that EFG presents volumetric locking. In fact, it is concluded that an increase of the dilation parameter attenuates, but never suppresses, the volumetric locking and that, as in standard finite elements, an increase in the order of reproducibility (interpolation degree) reduces the relative number of locking modes. Here an improved formulation of the EFG method is proposed in order to alleviate volumetric locking.Diffuse derivatives are defined in the thesis of the second author and their convergence to the derivatives of the exact solution, when the radius of the support goes to zero (for a fixed dilation parameter), it is proved. Therefore, diffuse divergence converges to the exact divergence. Since the diffuse divergence-free condition can be imposed a priori, new interpolation functions are defined that asymptotically verify the incompressibility condition. Modal analysis and numerical results for classical benchmark tests in solids corroborate this issue. Copyright {\copyright} 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This approach is consistently built upon the smoothed gradients of meshfree shape functions defined on two-level nesting triangular sub-domains, where each integration cell consists of four equal-area nesting sub-domains. First, a rational measure is designed to evaluate the error of the gradient smoothing integration for the stiffness matrix. Thereafter through a detailed analysis of the gradient smoothing integration errors associated with the two-level nesting triangular sub-domains, a quadratically exact algorithm for the stiffness matrix integration is established through optimally combining the contributions from the two-level nesting sub-domains. Meanwhile, the integration of force terms consistent with the stiffness integration is presented in order to ensure exact quadratic solutions within the Galerkin formulation. It is noted that the proposed approach with quadratic exactness shares the same foundation as the well-established stabilized conforming nodal integration method with linear exactness, i.e., the smoothed derivatives of meshfree shape functions are directly built upon the values of meshfree shape functions on the boundary of the integration cells and the time consuming derivative computations are completely avoided. Moreover, the present formulation has even less integration sampling points than the four point Gauss integration. Numerical examples show very favorable performance regarding the accuracy and efficiency for the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {A reproducing kernel gradient smoothing framework with explicit quadrature rules is proposed for efficient Galerkin meshfree formulation. In this framework, the meshfree smoothed gradients are formulated via a reproducing kernel representation of the standard gradients of field variables. It is interesting to find that this reproducing kernel construction of smoothed gradients of meshfree shape functions enables an identical satisfaction of the integration constraint derived from Galerkin meshfree formulation. In other words, the integration consistency is an inherent property of the proposed reproducing kernel gradient smoothing methodology regardless of integration schemes. Consequently, without violation of the integration constraint, the conventional normal low order Gauss quadrature rules in finite element analysis now can be used to properly integrate the meshfree stiffness matrix simply through replacing the standard meshfree gradients with the reproducing kernel smoothed gradients at Gauss points. In order to efficiently compute the reproducing kernel smoothed gradients, a set of explicit quadrature rules referring to 2D triangular and 3D tetrahedral integration cells are systematically developed. The total number of sample points associated with these quadrature rules is minimized from a global point of view through introducing an equivalent number of sample points, which implies as many as sample points are shared by neighboring integration cells. The proposed methodology recovers the stabilized conforming nodal integration when linear basis function is employed, while the focus of the present work is multidimensional higher order basis functions such as quadratic and cubic ones. Superior convergence, accuracy as well as efficiency performances of the proposed reproducing kernel gradient smoothing framework are thoroughly demonstrated by a series of numerical examples.},

  abstract = {A weighted strong form collocation method using radial basis functions and explicit time integration is proposed to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The velocities and pressure are solved directly at the same time step and the continuity equation is satisfied at each time step which improve the solution accuracy and stability. No artificial compressibility coefficient needs to be introduced for modeling the incompressible flows and no pressure oscillation arises in the numerical solutions. Optimal convergence can be achieved by imposing the derived proper weights on the boundaries and the continuity equation. Radial basis collocation method in a Lagrangian form is quite easy to capture the moving boundary or free surface in flow problems. Moreover, solid boundary conditions can be enforced directly and no special treatments are required. Further, critical time step for the explicit time integration is predicted in the stability analysis and the influences on the stability are evaluated. Numerical studies validate the high accuracy as well as good stability of the presented method.},

  abstract = {Generating quality body-fitting meshes for complex composite microstructures is a non-trivial task. In particular, micro-CT images of composites can contain numerous irregularly-shaped inclusions. Among the methods available, immersed boundary methods that discretize bodies independently provide potential for tackling these types of problems since a matching discretization is not needed. However, these techniques still entail the explicit parameterization of the interfaces, which may be considerable in number. In this work, immersed volumetric Nitsche methods are developed in order to avoid the difficulty of generating body fitting meshes for composite materials with complicated microstructures, and overcome the issues in the surface-type methods. These approaches are developed using Nitsche's techniques to enforce volumetric continuity between the inclusion and background domains. It is shown that the proposed weak forms are fully consistent with the strong form of the composite problem. The present approach permits C0 approximations for the foreground discretization, and C1 approximations for the background. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated by solving homogeneous and inhomogeneous composite benchmark problems, where it is shown that the non-symmetric version of Nitsche's approach is the most robust in all settings.},

  abstract = {The stable node-based smoothed particle finite element method (SNS-PFEM) reduces spatial numerical oscillation from direct nodal integration in NS-PFEM but leads to a severe volumetric locking effect when modeling nearly incompressible materials-related boundary value problems. This study proposes an improved locking-free SNS-PFEM to investigate the performance of the bubble function and selective integration scheme in circumventing volumetric locking. Three locking-free variants of SNS-PFEM: (1) SNS-PFEM with a cubic bubble function (bSNS-PFEM), (2) SNS-PFEM with a selective integration scheme (selective SNS-PFEM), and (3) SNS-PFEM with a cubic bubble function and selective integration scheme (selective bSNS-PFEM)---were gradually developed for comparison. The performance of these three approaches was first successively examined using two examples with elastic materials, that is, an infinite plate with a circular hole and Cook's membrane. The comparisons show that the cubic bubble function and selective integration scheme are both necessary as a locking-free approach for modeling nearly incompressible materials, and the proposed selective bSNS-PFEM performs best among the three variants in terms of accuracy and convergence. Two examples of slope stability analysis and footing penetration on elastoplastic materials were then conducted by SNS-PFEM and the proposed selective bSNS-PFEM. The results indicate that the proposed selective bSNS-PFEM is stable and accurate, even when accompanied by significant deformation. All obtained results indicate that the locking-free selective bSNS-PFEM is a powerful approach for modeling nearly incompressible materials with both material and geometric nonlinearity.},

  abstract = {A stabilized meshfree formulation for modeling nonlinear, multiphase porous media with application to landslide simulation is presented. To effectively capture the hydromechanical couplings between solid and fluid phases, an efficient equal-order approximation pair is adopted in conjunction with the fluid pressure projection in the mixed formulation, which avoids spurious pressure oscillations caused by the violation of the inf-sup condition. Although semi-Lagrangian meshfree methods are well-suited for modeling extremely large deformation phenomena, their performance is severely impacted by improper domain integration techniques. In this work, the naturally stabilized nodal integration (NSNI) technique is employed to achieve a stable and efficient reproducing kernel mixed formulation. By using the implicit gradient approximation, the gradients of strain and fluid flux fields are added into the mixed formulation to eliminate spurious low-energy modes of nodal integration. This procedure adds little computational effort to the overall analysis. In addition, a set of modified test functions is introduced to ensure the variational consistency in the Galerkin formulation for multiphase porous media. The convergence, stability, and effectiveness of the semi-Lagrangian meshfree formulation are examined and demonstrated in several numerical examples, including the post-failure modeling of a partially saturated levee.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach in the construction of meshfree approximations as well as the weak Kronecker-delta property at the boundary, referred to as a generalized meshfree (GMF) approximation. The GMF approximation introduces an enriched basis function in the original Shepard's method. This enriched basis function is introduced to meet the linear or higher order reproducing conditions and at the same time to offer great flexibility on the control of the smoothness and convexity of the approximation. The construction of the GMF approximation can be viewed as a special root-finding scheme of constraint equations that enforces that the basis functions are corrected and the reproducing conditions with certain orders are satisfied within a set of nodes. By choosing different basis functions, various convex and nonconvex approximations including moving least-squares (MLS), reproducing kernel (RK), and maximum entropy (ME) approximations can be obtained. Furthermore, the basis function can also be translated or blended with other functions to generate a particular approximation for a special purpose. One application in this paper is to incorporate a blending function at the boundary based on the concept of local convexity for the non-convex approximation, such as MLS, to acquire the weak Kronecker-delta property. To achieve the higher order GMF approximation, two possible methods are also introduced. Several examples are presented to examine the effectiveness of various GMF approximations.

  abstract = {In this paper, a two-dimensional displacement-based meshfree-enriched FEM (ME-FEM) is presented for the linear analysis of compressible and near-incompressible planar elasticity. The ME-FEM element is established by injecting a first-order convex meshfree approximation into a low-order finite element with an additional node. The convex meshfree approximation is constructed using the generalized meshfree approximation method and it possesses the Kronecker-delta property on the element boundaries. The gradient matrix of ME-FEM element satisfies the integration constraint for nodal integration and the resultant ME-FEM formulation is shown to pass the constant stress test for the compressible media. The ME-FEM interpolation is an element-wise meshfree interpolation and is proven to be discrete divergence-free in the incompressible limit. To prevent possible pressure oscillation in the near-incompressible problems, an area-weighted strain smoothing scheme incorporated with the divergence-free ME-FEM interpolation is introduced to provide the smoothing on strains and pressure. With this smoothed strain field, the discrete equations are derived based on a modified Hu--Washizu variational principle. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the compressible and near-incompressible problems.

  abstract = {Presently, it has been widely recognized that numerical integration plays a crucial role on the solution accuracy of Galerkin meshfree methods due to the rational nature of meshfree shape functions and the misalignment of shape function supports with integration cells. Nonetheless, the corresponding underlying cause is still not quite clear. To address this issue, an accuracy analysis of Galerkin meshfree methods is presented in this study with a special focus on the contribution of numerical integration to the error estimates. One important fact is that the integration difficulty of meshfree methods leads to a loss of the Galerkin orthogonality condition which usually serves as a basis to develop error bounds. In order to enable the accuracy analysis, an error measure is proposed to evaluate the loss of Galerkin orthogonality condition, which is actually related to the order of integration consistency for Galerkin meshfree formulation. With the aid of this orthogonality error measure, both H1 and L2 error estimates are established for Galerkin meshfree methods. It turns out that these errors essentially consist of two parts, one comes from the standard interpolation error, and the other one attributes to the numerical integration error. In accordance with the proposed error estimates, it is evident that for the conventional Gauss integration schemes violating the integration consistency, the solution errors eventually are controlled by the integration error and optimal convergence cannot be achieved even with high order quadrature rules. On the other hand, for the consistent integration approaches, e.g., the stabilized conforming nodal integration and the more recent reproducing kernel gradient smoothing integration, the integration and interpolation errors have the same accuracy order and thus an optimal convergence of Galerkin meshfree methods is ensured. The proposed theoretical error estimates for Galerkin meshfree methods are well demonstrated by numerical results.},

Necessary prerequisites for the reading of this book are summarized, with or without proof, in Chapter 0 under titles: Set Theory, Topo\- logical Spaces, Measure Spaces and Linear Spaces. Then, starting with the chapter on Semi-norms, a general theory of Banach and Hilbert spaces is presented in connection with the theory of generalized functions of S. L. SOBOLEV and L. SCHWARTZ. While the book is primarily addressed to graduate students, it is hoped it might prove useful to research mathe\- maticians, both pure and applied. The reader may pass, e. g. , from Chapter IX (Analytical Theory of Semi-groups) directly to Chapter XIII (Ergodic Theory and Diffusion Theory) and to Chapter XIV (Integration of the Equation of Evolution). Such materials as "Weak Topologies and Duality in Locally Convex Spaces" and "Nuclear Spaces" are presented in the form of the appendices to Chapter V and Chapter X, respectively.
