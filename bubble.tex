\subsection{Bubble mesh generator}
The proposed method embeds the optimal pressure DOFs to release the burden of volumetric locking. In order to maintain the number of pressure DOFs to be optimal, $n_p=n_c$, the Shimada method or namely bubble meshing method is used to generate the pressure nodes. 
In Shimada method, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cloud}, a meshing node $\boldsymbol x_I$ is regard as a bubble with specific radius $r_I$ and mass $m_I$, the corresponding nodal location are determined by a dynamic system as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{bubble1}
    m_I \ddot{\boldsymbol x}_{I} + c_I \dot{\boldsymbol x}_I = \sum_{J=1}^{n_p} \bar{\boldsymbol f}_{IJ}
\end{equation}
where the dot notion over the $\boldsymbol x$ means to the time derivation of $\boldsymbol x$, i.e. $\dot{\boldsymbol x}_I, \ddot{\boldsymbol x}_I$ stands for the $\boldsymbol x_I$'s acceleration and velocity. 
The parameters $m_I, c_I$ dnotes mass and viscosity of the bubble at $\boldsymbol x_I$, and, for a better meshing efficiency and stability, these two parameters are obtained through \cite{dinh2017}:
\begin{equation} \label{bubble2}
    k = \frac{1.47}{2r_I}, \quad \zeta = \frac{c_I}{2\sqrt{m_I k}} = 0.7
\end{equation}
The interaction forces between adjacent bubbles $\bar{\boldsymbol f}_{IJ}$'s is given by:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\boldsymbol f}_{IJ} = \frac{\boldsymbol x_I - \boldsymbol x_J}{d_{IJ}} \bar f_{IJ}, \quad
\bar f_{IJ} =
\begin{cases}
    (1-w^4) e^{-w^4} & 0\le w= \frac{d_{IJ}}{r_I+r_J} \le 1.5 \\
    0 & w>1.5
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $d_{IJ} = \Vert \boldsymbol x_I - \boldsymbol x_J \Vert$ denotes the distance between $\boldsymbol x_I$ and $\boldsymbol x_J$.

Subsequently, the locations $\boldsymbol x_I$'s can be got by solve the above Eq. \eqref{bubble2} using conventional fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.

As shown in Figure. \ref{fig:cloud}, the detailed meshing steps are listed as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate the elements for displacement using traditional meshing algorithm, for example Frontal-Delaunay algorithm , where the number of the displacement nodes is $n_u$. 
    \item Arrange the fixed pressure nodes on the boundary before locating nodes in the domain, and the bubbles of the boundary nodes should cover all boundaries to avoid the internal nodes escaping out.
    \item Place a specific number of nodes in the domain and let the total number of pressure nodes equal to optimal one based on the number of displacement nodes, i.e. $n_p = n_c(n_u)$. \label{step3}
    \item Determine the locations of the nodes generated by Step. \ref{step3} via solving Eq. \eqref{bubble1} using fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

In this mixed approximation, due to the locality of finite element shape functions and the globality of meshfree shape functions, the numerical integration for assembling the stiffness matrices is carried out in the elements of finite element approximation. 
The previous works have figured out that, the overlapping supports and the rational property of meshfree shape functions will cause a mismatch between shape function and its derivate in the procedure of the numerical integration by parts. This phenomenon, namely integration constraint, will bring the lower accurate results, and can be alleviated using higher order Gaussian quadrature rules or more efficient consistent meshfree integration rules. 
However, there is no similar problems in proposed mixed-formulations for incompressible elasticity or heat diffusion problems, since only meshfree shape functions are adopted in weak forms of Eqs. \eqref{}.
So just using the lower order Gaussian quadrature rules used in traditional finite element method can meet the accuracy requirement.
